# AI Theory & Code — Unified Knowledge Repository

A concise, structured collection of my personal understanding of AI/ML theory, papers, and practical implementations. This repository captures how I interpret, simplify, and break down complex concepts into clear mathematics, intuitive explanations, and working code. While many implementations are assisted by AI tools, each piece reflects a personalized learning process, human insight, and my own way of understanding modern AI systems.

This repository includes:
	•	🧠 Theory notes simplifying research papers into digestible concepts
	•	🔢 Mathematical breakdowns of algorithms, loss functions, and derivations
	•	🧩 Code implementations
	•	🔬 Experiments and ablations demonstrating behaviors and insights
	•	🧪 Step-by-step walkthroughs explaining model internals
	•	📄 Project examples
	•	⚙️ Utility scripts and reusable components for training and evaluation

This is an evolving, long-term knowledge base meant to document how I learn, interpret, and implement AI—combining theory, math, and practical coding into one cohesive resource.
